# Mask Classification Using CNN (Artificial Intelligence)
 Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch and train it to recognize five different classes: (1) Person without a face mask, (2) Person with a “community” (cloth) face mask, (3) Person with a “surgical” (procedural) mask, (4) Person with a “FFP2/N95/KN95”-type mask (you do not have to distinguish between them), and (5) Person with a FFP2/N95/KN95 mask that has a valve. You do not have to consider other mask types (e.g., FFP3), face shields, full/half-face respirators, PPEs, or images that do not show a single face (e.g., groups of people).
